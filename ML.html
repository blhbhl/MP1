                        <p>Blacklist International’s Johnmar “OhMyV33NUS” Villaluna made history over the weekend by leapfrogging Jeniel “YellyHaze” Bata-anon of Nexplay Evos in the all-time leaders in assists, in a double celebration for the team after sweeping Smart Omega in Week 2 of the MPL Philippines Season 11.<br><br.

                            Villaluna, or “The Queen” as she is affectionately known, has now accumulated an impressive 2,266 assists in her career, which started in Season 4 with Onic Philippines. This achievement is a testament to her consistency and dedication to the game, having skipped Season 9 to rest and prepare for the M4 World Championship, yet not missing a beat in Season 10, where she led her team to another MPL championship, becoming one of the winningest players in MPL PH history with three titles under her belt.</p>
